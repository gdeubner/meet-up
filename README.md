This web app was created using React. It is a mock app, to simulate setting meeting times/locations on a dashboard. It allows you to view your list of meetings, add new meetings, and favorite your meetings.

This is a mock app, in that it does not have a back end. Instead, I used firebase to allow me to focus on creating the front end aplication.

To run the app, clone the repository, cd to the location of the repository, run 'npm install' to download the necessary dependencies, and then run 'npm start'.

Requirements: a modern web browser and Node.js installed.
